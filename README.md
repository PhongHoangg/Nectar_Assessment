# Nectar_Assessment
Phong Hoang Nectar Assessment Report
This repository contains a comprehensive data assessment, including SQL questions, A/B testing analysis, and a Python-based interactive dashboard. The project is structured into three parts:

## Project Structure
Written Report:

Answers all SQL-based questions and provides detailed insights into the data.
Includes an extensive discussion of A/B testing methodologies and their application to customer retention problems. The A/B testing section is designed to offer insights applicable to a wide range of scenarios beyond the specific question posed.
Python Dashboard:

A Python file (streamlit_dashboard.py) that creates an interactive dashboard to explore key metrics such as total revenue, conversion rates, retention rates, and more.
Includes creative and interactive visualizations for dynamic metric comparison.
Hosted Dashboard:

A hosted link to the interactive dashboard for quick access and exploration.
## Key Features
### 1. SQL Questions
SQL answers were whiteboarded, using the current timestamp during development.
The answers may differ slightly if computed on a different dataset or with real-time data.
The findings were revalidated and presented using Python in the dashboard.
### 2. A/B Testing Analysis
Extensive discussion of A/B testing methodologies, including:
Experiment setup, data preparation, and metric analysis.
Statistical testing options, with a focus on the chi-square test for this project.
Insights into how A/B testing can be applied to customer retention challenges and broader use cases.
Includes recommendations on how to evaluate the effect of new features on key metrics such as conversion rates and retention rates.
### 3. Interactive Dashboard
The dashboard provides:

Dynamic Filtering:
Adjust date ranges to explore metrics over custom time periods.
Key Metrics:
Total signups, total revenue, conversion rate, and retention rate.
Presented creatively with an HTML-based design for compatibility across Streamlit versions.
Interactive Visualizations:
Select between revenue trends, message activity trends, and retention funnel views.
View bar charts, line charts, and funnel charts dynamically based on user preferences.
